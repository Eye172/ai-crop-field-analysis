## Stage 1 Design Notes

- The system processes aerial images of crop fields.
- Images are divided into fixed-size grid sectors.
- Each sector is analyzed independently.
- Results are reconstructed into a unified annotated field map.

Stage 1 focuses on correctness, modularity, and interpretability rather than model complexity.
