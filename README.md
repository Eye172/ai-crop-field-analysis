# AI-Based Crop Field Analysis Using Aerial Imagery
This project explores how aerial imagery can be processed and analyzed using computer vision and machine learning techniques to assess crop field conditions.

The system simulates drone-based data collection using public aerial or satellite datasets. Images are divided into grid-based sectors, analyzed independently, and reconstructed into an annotated field map highlighting areas potentially affected by weed growth or other conditions requiring agricultural attention.

## Project Status
Stage 1 — Grid-based image processing and baseline analysis (in_progress)

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Scope Notes
- No physical drone control (simulation only for now)
